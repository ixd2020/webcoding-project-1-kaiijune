      Katsushika Hokusai’s woodblock print <a href="#">The Great Wave</a> is one
      of the most famous and recognizable works of art in the world. This work
      is from Hokusai’s much-celebrated series Thirty-Six Views of Mount Fuji
      (Fugaku sanjûrokkei), a tour-de-force that established the popularity of
      landscape prints, which continues to this day. Hokusai spent the majority
      of his life in the capital of Edo, now Tokyo, and lived in a staggering 93
      separate residences. Despite this frenetic movement, he produced tens of
      thousands of sketches, prints, illustrated books, and paintings. He also
      frequently changed the name he used to sign works of art, and each change
      signaled a shift in artistic style and intended audience. When he was
      nineteen, he began working at the studio of Katsukawa Shunshô (1726–92), a
      well-known designer of actor prints. Initially, Hokusai followed in his
      teacher’s footsteps and produced prints of popular Kabuki actors, but his
      insatiable curiosity about different ways of seeing the world led him to
      study a multitude of artistic styles. These included the native Rinpa and
      Kano schools, as well as foreign modes based on Dutch imports such as oil
      paintings, copperplates, telescopes, and other optical devices. These
      influences can be found in Hokusai’s art, but it is his mastery and
      integration of styles that point towards his own personal, entirely new
      style. This maturity can best be seen in his Thirty-Six Views of Mount
      Fuji (Fugaku sanjûrokkei), series, which includes The Great Wave. The Art
      Institute owns three versions of this famous work, one of which retains
      the pink sky that is faded in almost every other copy. The museum’s
      collection includes a total of nearly 600 works by Hokusai. Scholars have
      observed that Hokusai’s obsession with Mount Fuji was tied to his personal
      quest for immortality—the artist felt his artwork would transcend the
      divine, if only he could live long enough. He wrote that “at [age] one
      hundred and ten, every dot and every stroke will be as though alive.”
      Although he only lived to the age of about 90, his works have achieved
      true immortality through their widespread recognition.
